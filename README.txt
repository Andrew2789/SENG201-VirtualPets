Requires Java 1.8

To run the jar file:
java -jar VirtualPets.jar

To open the project in eclipse:
Import Source/VirtualPets to a new java project in eclipse such that Source/VirtualPets/src merges with the default src folder, 
and such that the resources folder is on the same level as src.
Run the project using GuiRunner.

Our JUnit tests are in their own package in src (src/unittests).
